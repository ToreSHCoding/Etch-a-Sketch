# Etch-a-Sketch
Virtual drawing sketchpad made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help practice and understand DOM manipulation.

It uses a grid and .forEach() to utilize eventListeners() such as 'click' and 'mouseover' in order to create a virtual pixel drawing tablet. 

This project is just a prototype. I may come back to rewrite the code more effeciently.
